## Purpose of the Website
The purpose of **QCfirst** is to allow students to view their courses and enroll in new courses. It also allows instructors to manage, add and delete courses.

## Website Link and Contributions
**Link to our website:** https://nikhitakannam71.github.io/qcfirst/

**Contributions:**
* **Christen:** We both made contributions to the index or Sign In page and decided upon the appropriate images to put across the website legally, including the logo and other images. In addition, I specifically worked on the pages for the instructor side, like the Instructor Sign Up Page, Instructor Home Page, Course Management Page and finally the Create Course Page which my partner decided that we should add to fullfil part of the site's requirements. I also suggested on using an online collaborative editor called Code Collab: https://codecollab.io/ so that we can seamlessly work on this project.
* **Nikhita:** My partner and I worked on the Sign In or index.html page together. We both contributed to picking the appropriate images for the site. I worked on the pages for the student side such as Student Sign Up, Student Home Page and Enrollment Page. I pushed the HTML files to github and created the link using Github Pages, as my partner suggested. 

## Features
* **Sign In Page:** The welcome page where students and instructors can enter their login info in the appropriate text boxes. If a user account doesn't exist, they can sign up using one of the two buttons below the *Enter* button.
* **Student/Instructor Sign Up Page**: Users can enter their information to create an account. After entering their information, click *Enter* to create the account. 
* **Student Home Page:**   In the student home page, students can view their personal information such as Name, CUNY ID and email address. They can also view the courses they are already enrolled in. If the student wished to enroll in a new course, they can click the *Enroll* button at the bottom of the page. 
* **Instructor Home Page:** In the instructor home page, instructors can view their personal information including name, ID number, and email address as well as the list of courses they have created. To manage courses, click the *Manage Courses* button below the picture section.
* **Enrollment Page:** This page allows students to search and enroll in new classes. Enter the course in the search bar. Once the user finds the course they are looking for they can select that course and click *Enroll*. Students can also view their updated schedule. 
* **Course Management Page:** Strictly for instructors; they can create and delete any desired course by clicking on the appropriate buttons below the list of courses that's displayed. To find a *specific course*, instructors can type the course name in the search text box. To find more information about a course, such as its unique number, department, description, enrolmment deadline, and etc. click on the *arrow down* button next to the course name to reveal a dropdown that contains these unique information. 
* **Create Course Page:** Strictly for instructors. This page allows instructors to create a new course. They have to enter the course information such as course ID, department, description, capacity, etc. After entering their information, the instructor can click *Create Course* to create a new course. 


## Visual Design VS Final Design
* **Color** - The colors in the final design are more appealing and modern. Some sections had a black background and were transparent. This was to make it easier for users to read text and for the site to appear more organized. 
* **Background images** - Added them for each appropriate page in the final design since we thought the pages looked too basic and lacked an aesthetic vibe. 
* **Logo** - We had to choose a Logo that does not violate copyright laws. 
* **Navigation Bar** - We added a navigation bar to make it easier for users to navigate between different pages. 
* **Ability to switch between rosters** - In the instructor home page, we added an option in each course for instructors to choose between which course student roster they want to switch to.
* **IDs and Classes to tags** - We added a CSS class and/or id to each one of our div and section tags to follow the semantic HTML design criteria.
